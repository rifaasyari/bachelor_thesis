function [W] = mmse_filter(H, signal_power, noise_power)
% MMSE_FILTER Implements the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) filter for
% MIMO systems [1]. This filter minimizes the  error between the transmitted 
% symbol and its estimate at the filter output
%
%   Input
%       H: Complex channel gain matrix
%       signal_power: Power of transmitted signals
%       noise_power: Power of noise over the channel
%
%   Output
%       W: MMSE filter which minimizes error between transmitted symbol s
%           and its estimate ≈ù = ctranspose(W) * y where y is the received
%           signal.
